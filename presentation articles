Verification of continuous Time recurrent Neural network 


the verification of CT RNN has not been explored a lot
RNN are more efficient to solve problems in which there is a time relationship between the events

this article proposes 2 benchmarks for the verification 

1st : approximation of Fixed point Attractor
2nd : system identification for forced damped pendulum

they have simulate the 2 problems and obtained good results but they are on low dimensional CTRNN 

pbm : scalability : the number of connections between neurons  increases qauadratically with the numbers of neurons.A real world neural network can contain millions of neurons.
